Design overview: In this project every action is decleared by a c function. We have prompt function to hande all commands and act them properly. In prompt method firs we declare our char arrays for commands and create a pthread_t pth to handle with concurrent commands.We have a while loop to ask to user a command until he type exit. First thing firs I have splitted the user command in order to decide which commands  will be executed sequentially which ones concurently.when I splitting I created a 2 string array for cocncurrent and sequential commands and 2 pthread array for holding concurrent commands as it needs. End of my prompt fucntion is simply iterate over these 2 string arrays sequential and concurrent array and call 2 method first one is SequentialCommands for sequential command other one is ConcurrentCommands for concurrent commands. These 2 methods excepts command strings as parameters and handle them properly.Each action has it own methods like split haid tail extc. each function calle in SequentialCommands and ConcurrentCommands functions accordingly but the main difference is ConcurrentCommands function calling with using pthreads beacuse we want to execute concurrently.

Complete specification: For ambiguities splitToken fucntion trys to split commands with : , ; and >If the function couldn't split string immediately gives a error and ask again.

Known bugs or problems: There are several errors and bugs in my code. First confusion of program is sppitting commands sometimes some functions like replace doesn't work when we write it end od the commands ex: lineCount input.txt ; replace input.txt  doesn't work but when we erite replace input.txt ; lineCount input.txt. Also insert and replace functions itselfs there are some bugs when we call it with threads. I assume that I used mutexs wrongly with file opearations.
